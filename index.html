<h1>Max Rose</h1>
<h2>About me:</h2>
<p>(INCLUDE PIC OF MYSELF)
My name is Max Rose and I am 20 years old. I was born in Brisbane and I have lived in Melbourne since I was one year old, however I am 50% Croatian from my Mothers side. Since prep, I attended Melbourne Grammar School moving from the Caulfield campus to the South Yarra Campus when I graduated to middle and high school. After I finished my secondary education, I took part in a Bachelor of Media and Communications at RMIT however I decided to defer my studies for the second semester as I wasn’t satisfied with my course and decided to the Army Reserves as a member of the RASIGS Corps (Royal Australian Signals). I decided to change my course to Bachelor of IT as it was always something that I have loved and been interested in, and to be honest I probably should have been in this course instead of Media anyway!</p>

<p>I am an avid masochist when it comes to gaming, so my favourite series are the souls series. I have played through all the souls games from FromSoftware and my power rankings from best to worst are as followed (I still can't beat the final boss of Sekiro, and I haven’t beat Elden Ring yet):
<ul style="margin-top:-15px;" style="margin-bottom:-30px;">
  <li>Bloodborne</li>
  <li>Dark souls 3</li>
  <li>Dark souls</li>
  <li>Dark souls 2 SotFS</li>
</ul>
I don’t really prefer a particular favourite genre of games as I will anything a go if it respects my time (looking at you Ubisoft and EA), however I do like games that involve strategy and making you think and engage with the mechanics. My favourite games of all time in no order are Bloodborne, Destiny 2, Slay the Spire, Pokémon Heart Gold, Thumper (I beg you to please check this one out, absolute hidden gem), Doom Eternal, Death Stranding and XCOM 2.</p>

<p>I was always a ‘Sony Pony’ and had a PS3 and a PS4, however I decided to build my own PC in October of last year. And if you are wondering how much I spent on my GPU, no comment…
The specs for my PC are: (INCLUDE PHOTO OF PC HERE!)
<ul style="margin-top:-15px;" style="margin-bottom:-30px;">
  <li>AMD Ryzen 3600 (looking to upgrade to a 5600x soon)</li>
  <li>Asus TUF B550-M plus WIFI Motherboard</li>
  <li>EVGA FTW 3070ti</li>
  <li>16Gb of 3200mhz RAM</li>
  <li>500Gb Seagate Firecudea Gen4 NVMe SSD (Boot drive)</li>
  <li>2Tb Samsung 970 Pro Gen3 NVMe (Mass storage)</li>
  <li>Fractal 850w Gold power supply</li>
  <li>Arctic E-sports duo CPU cooler</li>
  <li>Corsair 4000D Airflow case</li>
</ul> </p>

<p>I am also a cinema/film enjoyer as with my favourite films of all time being Whiplash, Se7en, Pig, White Chicks and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind; with my favourite TV shows of all time being Breaking Bad, Inbetweeners UK, Curb your enthusiasm, Neon Genesis Evangelion (a super fun and happy show! Not sad or weird at all!) and Eric Andre Show. </p>

<p>I am also a huge music head who is a lover of all genres as long it is listenable and I can find enjoyment in it, however I do prefer rap and hip hop. Some of my favourite albums of all time are Good Kid m.A.A.d City and To Pimp a Butterfly by Kendrick Lamar, Igor by Tyler the Creator, The Money Store by Death Grips, every Kanye West album, Saturation 2, 3 and Roadrunner by BROCKHAMPTON, The New Abnormal by The Strokes, Kill Them All by Metallica and finally Nonagon Infinity, I'm in your Mind Fuzz and Infest the Rats Nest by Melbourne’s own King Gizzard and the Lizard. I know you are definitely thinking “Wow this guy is so cultured and super cool, I wish I could have his Spotify playlist!” right now. Don’t worry, I got you covered: </p>

<p>My other interests include sport, namely AFL, Rugby, and Rowing. I have been a keen Western Bulldogs supporter since a kid, and I still have all the guernseys that I wore as a kid to the games that have player signatures on them. (PICTURE)</p>

<h2>Interest in IT: (PHOTO OF POKEMON HEART GOLD)</h2>
<p>My interest in IT began back as a kid when I remember getting my first ever game that I played, ‘Pokémon Heart Gold’ and ‘Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games (Beijing 2008)’ back when I was eight years old as a birthday present. I played both games for hours, with my Pokémon saving having a total of 461 hours and 56 minutes of play time on a single save, which I got by just repeat battling the elite four when I was bored. My interest in gaming and IT to the point where I bought a ROM hacking device for my DS to hack other DS games and play any other DS game, I wanted to via ripping the ROM online.</p>

<p>This lead me into primary school when I played countless hours of Team Fortress 2 payload and ‘Mann Vs Machine’ with my friends after school, where I pretty much exclusively played Scout and Sniper, however I stopped playing when I got angry and a guy spawn camping me when I accidentally slapped the body of the computer too hard and caused the hard drive inside to malfunction (oops) destroying one of the 2 family laptops (my mum still doesn’t know it was me even after nine or so years). I eventually started playing ‘DC Infinite Crisis’ on the family desktop until I eventually got my own iPad for school, which ended in numerous wipes of everything on it as I tried and failed many times to Jailbreak it.</p>

<p>Throughout middle school and high school, I joined clubs however after a while I stopped going as I enjoyed the physical hardware side of computers more than the software side. I had always dreamt of building my own computer but never had the excuse to do so, always using a laptop for my schoolwork as it was the only real option. Upon finishing high school and started studying Bachelor of Media and Communications at RMIT, I had somehow convinced my mum to help me fund my very own PC as it was for video editing that I would be doing in that course, and even when I decided to change course, she still helped me fund it as she knew it has always been a dream of mine to build it since a kid. Since building my PC I also have jail-broken my Nintendo Switch with custom firmware, fixed many computer troubles that my family has had, and overall been super enthusiastic about new tech hardware and software by watching Linus Tech Tips, Marquees Brownlee, GamersNexus and all the other tech YouTubers.</p>

<p>My main interest in IT is a mix of both software and hardware. I will go into more detail later in the ‘my dream job’ section but I find data centres and work centre stuff super interesting, as well as being also interested security (both physical and software) and storage solutions.</p>

<p>I chose to come to RMIT for IT because it was an easy choice to change courses rather than change entire Universities, as well as RMIT being have IT in the name. All jokes aside, I have heard great things about every course from RMIT as some of the people in the IT department at my dad’s work studied here and had glowing reviews about its culture, environment, professionalism, and quality of lecturers/tutors. Additionally, upon doing my own research when I decided to change course to IT and I was considering potentially different Universities, I had heard and read great things about the IT department online and when I got back in touch with my Informatics teacher at my high school, he also recommended RMIT.</p>

<p>In my studies during course, I expect to learn a deeper understanding of things. Right now, I consider my knowledge at a base surface level; I know and understand tech terminology and how things interact and work with each other at a quick glance. I know the differences between the GPU and the CPU, I know how overclocking works, I understand that being a software developer would be the most infuriating job in existence, how to use and protect data effectively, as well as knowing various other things like tiny bit of networking. I what I want to and expect to learn and take away from my studies in this course is that deep extra level of IT systems, hardware and software that I wouldn’t be able to learn anywhere else. I want to be able to gradate knowing the smallest details and how fundamental and extremely complex systems work and interact with each other and communicate to produce stuff and everything that out life is dependent on today. I want to be able to learn how silicon works and how it is turned into the tiny electronics that is inside my air fryer, I want to know how software is created and designed and how people can use the smallest little vulnerabilities can be exploited and cause entire systems that seem fool proof to completely screw over their users, as well as learning deployment of huge data centres and how even the tiniest little change in power voltages can cause yearly power bills to skyrocket or plumet. I guess the thing I'm trying to get at is I want to turn my interest of IT from a hobby with a hobby level of understanding to a full time job with a deep and complex knowledge and understanding of IT.</p>

<h2>My dream job:</h2>
<p>In terms of my dream job, I would want something that is a mixture of both hands on as well as software interactive based, as I am an active person who loves getting into the nitty gritty of little things like hardware and getting their hands dirty, but I don’t mind sitting behind a screen and doing things via software. In terms of work life balance, I would want something flexible as opposed to a nine to five as being able to participant in activities such as picking up my kids from school (if I choose to have them), as well as having the possibility of working from home or remotely and being able to travel would be great. In terms of pay obviously the ideal answer is a lot but realistically I'm not a very materialistic person and only upgrade when I need to (I only upgraded from my iPhone 6s to a 13 early this year as the battery life was abysmal), I don’t need all the brand new bells and whistles on everything but a comfortable salary that allows for a reasonable amount of savings every year to go towards things such as holidays or other luxuries would be ideal.</p>

<p>The three jobs that fit into these categories and that I find the most interesting are penetration testing, cyber security, and data/storage specialist. For the purposes of this exercise, I will talk about penetration testing.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">This is an example of a penetration testing job</a> that I found online that fits into my criteria. The job involves working in a group of people/a team to test out security capabilities as well as enhancing those security measures with new emerging technologies, processes, and procedures. I find this position desirable as it fits into my preference for having a mix of both physical hardware and software parts of the job, as well as being something that I am definitely interested in. Some of the requirements of this job are fairly basic things that pretty much every human should have, such as great teamwork, comprehensive language, verbal and communication skills. However, some other requirements have a much larger barrier to entry that could only be obtained through university degrees or courses, as well as on the job experience which could only be achieved via a job, such as knowledge and experience in using security and defence programs, as well as the use of administration software. Unfortunately even though I think I am pretty good at figuring stuff out myself, I wouldn’t be able to have some these job requirements without undertaking the relevant degrees or courses, as I have almost no knowledge of management or admin software. In order to achieve these relevant requirements, I would potentially need to sign up for extracurricular courses such as a TAFE in management or a similar certification course, or alternatively I could potentially obtain an internship at this or another company in order to gain real world work experience as well as build familiarity with this area of work, the software and other potential requirements.</p>

<h2>My Personal profile:</h2>
<p>For my personal profile, I undertook three different tests:
<ol style="margin-top:-15px;" style="margin-bottom:-30px;">
  <li> <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test">The Myers-Briggs 16 personalities test</a></li>
  <li> <a href="https://vark-learn.com/the-vark-questionnaire">The VARK questionnaire</a>(Visual, aural, read/write, kinaesthetic) which measures the best way in which you learn</li>
  <li>I was originally going to choose the Buzzfeed <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/mathewguiver/which-type-of-bread-are-you">'What type of Garlic Bread are you?'</a> but after reading the marking rubric where it explicitly states not to do that, I decided for my own sake to instead go with the <a href="https://www.truity.com/test/big-five-personality-test"> 5 big personalites test</a> which measures your personality based on OCEAN (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness and Neuroticism)</li>
</ol>

<p>The results of the Myers-Briggs 16 personality test came back as a ‘Virtuoso’ aka an ISTP-A/ISTP-T type, which is descibed as introverted, observent, thinking and prospecting.
In the VARK questionnaire I came back with my learning preference being multimodal, which prefers more hands-on learning as well as analysis via practical exercises, diagrams and charts as opposed to learning from reading and listening, with my scores being:
<ul style="margin-top:-15px;" style="margin-bottom:-30px;">
  <li>Visual: 6</li>
  <li>Aural: 8</li>
  <li>Read/Write: 3</li>
  <li>Kinaesthetic: 11</li>
</ul>
Finally on the 5 big personalities test I scored a with an openness of 69% (put a link to an image of nice), conscientiousness of 37.5%, extraversion of 33%, an agreeableness of 62.5% and a neuroticism of 56%. </p>

<p>I would tend to agree with these results very much on several fronts. Firstly, starting with the Myers-Briggs test, (ADD UR SHIT IN HERE!!!!!)
Secondly with the VARK questionnaire, I believe that this is very true and accurate to how I learn. As detailed in my job prospect, I explained that ideally, I would want a job that a combination of physical hands-on work as well as sit down at a desk type work, and this questionnaire confirms my preference for learning. Finally with the Big 5 personality test, it describes myself as someone who has a level of openness, agreeableness, and neuroticism with less of conscientiousness and extraversion, which is an assessment that I would also agree with. I tend to enjoy brainstorming a variety of different potential ideas and solutions to problems, but often have trouble putting those things from ‘pen to paper’ or enacting them, which would fit under the categories of high openness and lower conscientiousness. It also describes myself as someone who is quieter and more reserved as well as being more trustworthy and forgiving, which would fit under lower extraversion and higher agreeableness (I would hope so!). The final category under the big 5 test poses me as someone who can empathise with the emotions of other people, as well as understand and interpret that they are saying and being able to relate to them, which falls under an average level of neuroticism. </p>

<p>I think that when working in a team these results would influence how I interact with people and how I bring up ideas in a team. Instead of jumping in and trying to attack the problem right away, I would attempt to survey the issue and look at all the relevant information that pertains to it, and then try and figure out the solution to each problem and start to create a plan of attack to solve the issue for the task at head. For example, for a group project in which there are multiple parts that need to be completed, I would sit back and listen to everyone’s strengths and weaknesses as well as what like to do, then go through the criteria/outline and start to discuss what we could do for each part, and based on enthusiasm on how much one person is speaking for a certain section, I would then suggest which person could work on which part and get the work for the project underway.</p>

<p>I would take this into account when forming a team by finding and collaborating with a variety of people who don’t have the same result or thinking process as I do. For example, in terms of the VARK questionnaire I would want to form a team with someone who has a learning process of reading/writing, as that is not my strong suit. Additionally, I would also want to find someone from the Big 5 personality test who has high levels of extraversion, as they would be able to voice lots of points that someone who is more introverted wouldn’t want/be able to. And finally for the Myers-Briggs 16 personalities, I would also consider adding another person who is slightly similar yet also different to myself in that they are analytical, but they would be able to provide other insights and opinions/solutions that I wouldn’t necessarily pick up on.</p>

<h2>Project Idea:</h2>
<p>A summary of what my project idea is fairly simple. I have the idea to weigh things using sensors, light waves/frequencies and optic fibre as well as develop software or an app to record that data. “Well what kind of things?” I hear you asking yourself in an empty room late in the afternoon with your headphones on, listening to music as you mark my assignment. Well anything really I responded via words on a screen: people, food, medicine and the crushing emptiness that fills my life (joking, my family are very nice). Something like this could be used on an industry level to measure things on infinitesimally small scales like scientific research or chemistry and be used to calculate the density of things.</p>

<p>I think that this idea could be useful as it could (combined with the software/program/app) provide for an extremely exact and precise measurement of the tiniest and smallest things/objects that could be very useful in scientific applications such as chemistry in measuring specific weights of certain chemicals used in experiments and studies, and in medicine for weighing specific ‘mg’ doses of drugs/antibiotics for patients. I believe it could also be very useful in industrial applications like for weighing ingredients at food factories or in restaurants where exact measurements of ingredients are needed for things like pavlovas. The app would then allow the user to keep track of all this data.</p>

<p>A normal scale weighs things via pressure sensors however in comparison to my idea I plan to use light refraction in order to produce very precise and accurate measurements. To produce a result and to get an idea of how the insides of my scale would work, it would look like a normal scale on the outside with a plastic or metal covering where the object goes to be weighed, however underneath this covering I would have a small LED or a light at one end of multiple strands of optic fibre cabling that are spread out and attached both vertically and horizontally to the bottom of the covering (imagine a 3x3 table criss-cross pattern except a lot larger). The light would shine through the optic fibre with multiple sensors at the other end of each strand of cabling, that would then read the light output as well as the frequency. To translate the light signal into a weight, the software/app/program that is associated with this scale would then use take the x and y points from where the light was initially positioned (the zero point) and compare it to the x and y points of the new position in which the sensor picks up where the light is shining currently. Finally, mathematics and various formulas would be applied to the difference between the coordinates which could then be used to interpret it as a numerical weight number and provide it to the user.</p>

<p>The program would then allow the user to store these weight values (or even the raw x and y coordinates and differences between them) into a table where the user can create custom rows and columns to store multiple inputs which can be used to compare data sets for industrial or scientific applications, or even for an individual user to track their own weight over a period if they are trying to diet or exercise more, as well as allowing for creations of charts to visualise these numbers. The program would then allow the user to export/output these values into a variety of different formats, such as an excel file or a basic text document with the raw data. The software would also allow for formulas/arithmetic to be input so user don’t need to complete it elsewhere like a calculator e.g. if I want to find out how many cookies (y) would be made if I had x amount of brown sugar, and in each individual cookie there is 20 grams of brown sugar, the program would allow the user to input this equation in which would produce the raw coordinate values, raw weight value, and calculated result (y). For example: x = 3000g, then the formula input into the program would be x / 20 = y, with the calculation would be 3000 / 20 = 150 cookies. This is just a basic example, but other formulas such as ratioing (if I had this much of x then I would need that much of y) could be input. Additionally, because there are multiple points being measured in a 3D webbing and the weight on one side of the scale may be far greater than the other, it would allow the user to measure load bearing by producing a 3D map of the strands and which are under more pressure compared to others. For example, one leg of a 4-leg chair may weigh more than the other which would allow a chair making business to re design it so that the weight distribution is more even.</p>

<p>Obviously, this is a complicated piece of software so a really deep knowledge of software development and coding would be required to even attempt to create a program such as this. A potential option creating a variation of an SQL database of something such as Microsoft Access or other similar software could be possible as it allows for database and table creation however, I'm not sure how it would handle large datasets for industrial use as it can struggle with lots of values, as well as being reliant on another piece of software/a third party which requires licensing fees isn't the best idea. For the hardware items such as optic fibre, small LEDs and sensors wouldn’t be too expensive, and the electronics and computing needed for the interpreting from analogue to digital could be handled something such as a raspberry pi or an Arduino but something with a bit more processing power may be needed for large data sets, or alternatively it could be handled on a software side but that would create even more complexity to the program.</p>

<p>I believe that once this project is complete or if I actually made this project it wouldn’t necessarily solve a problem that exist, but instead provide an in-depth and industrial level product that will be able to produce much more accurate results then other similar products, while also providing a very large variety and suite of extra mathematic, processing, data collating and imaging functions that would collate the unnecessary use of multiple other programs by making this program and hardware a one stop shop for all the needs that the user could want.</p>
